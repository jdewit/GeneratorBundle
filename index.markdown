        Generate Symfony2 related code from the command line!
        With this bundle you can generate or update 
        all classes related to an entity with just a few commands!
        You can even build onto an existing entity.

        This bundle allows you to easily create your own templates, place and render them 
        in the path of your choice, and generate code from a mapped
        entity.

        The bundle is a work in progress but is working...most of the time :) 
        Currently it only provides support for Doctrine ORM. 

        The code still needs to get cleaned up a fair bit but the code that 
        it does generate is pretty solid. 

        Any help would be much appreciated!
    </p>
